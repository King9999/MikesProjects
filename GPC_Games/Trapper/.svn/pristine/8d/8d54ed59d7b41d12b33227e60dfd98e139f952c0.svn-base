=====================================
The theme for GPCv17 is "island" and "entanglement."  Trapper! is a game where you must travel to
different islands and capture exotic creatures for research.  Trapper! is a puzzle game where the player lures
creatures into traps; when you move, all creatures move at the same time, but in opposite directions.
