<div class="window"><br><p>This is a personal project that I've completed and published on the Windows Phone Marketplace. It began as an idea that I had for a puzzle game based on a mini-puzzle that various commercial games used. I felt that such a puzzle was good enough to be a standalone game, so I expanded on it. I first created the game as a school project for my XNA class, and then re-created it for my Dragonfire SDK class (just to prove that I could do it).  Once I was satisfied with the result, I went back to XNA, and re-wrote the game from scratch in my spare time. <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-CA/apps/94d7a0e4-e013-4500-9817-e99b28631030" target="_blank">Tile Crusher is available now for Windows Phone 7!</a></p>

<p>I created a tool to help me design levels fast and easily (picture shown on left). Right now the released game has 50 levels, but it shouldn't be a problem to double the number. I would only do it with enough support, though.  I wrote a postmortem on Gamasutra, which you can find <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MikeMurray/20120520/170552/Tile_Crusher__A_Postmortem.php">here.</a></p>
