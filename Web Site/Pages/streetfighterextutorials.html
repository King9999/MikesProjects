<div class="window"><br><br><p>A few years ago, I randomly decided to make tutorial videos for Street Fighter EX+ Alpha, which is the first 3D Street Fighter game released back in 1997. I made these videos for a few reasons: 1) I didn't like how most people made these kinds of videos, where all they do is show that they completed the missions without any explanation of how to do them; 2) SFEX's expert training mode is a feature that's underutilized in modern fighting games, so I wanted to show the flexibility of this system; and 3)the SFEX games are terribly underrated, and I enjoy the games a lot. If you want to be amused, ask someone who knows of these games why they don't like them. Unless you're a hardcore fighting game enthusiast, most people can't explain why they dislike this series for no other reason than "it's 3D." Of course, 3D Street Fighter is accepted now due to the popularity of SF4, but Capcom's first foray into 3D was really well done if you took the time to explore it. Some mechanics that are used in modern games got their ideas from SFEX, which includes the expert training mode.</p>
