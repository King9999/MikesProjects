<div class="window"><br><br><p>I Lost My Marbles! was made for <a href="http://www.tojam.ca/home/default.asp">Toronto Game Jam 8.</a> I was part of a team for this
project. I was responsible for the coding the scripts. The game has four levels, and the objective is to reach the end before time runs out. You can get more time by smashing things, even though you're instructed not to! TO Jam was a great experience for me, and I would definitely participate again. I always wanted to do it since I attended one of their arcades in October 2011 and saw some really cool games.  Plus, I won the grand prize from the raffle at that event which, admittedly, was a motivating factor to participate in a TO Jam. I finally got my chance!</p> 
<p>CONTROLS: WASD to move, Spacebar to confirm/pause game. Xbox 360 controller is supported.</p>
