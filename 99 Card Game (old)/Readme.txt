///			1. WHAT IS "99"?		///
//////////////////////////////////////

99 is a card game I used to play way back in elementary school.  My teacher introduced it
to the class one day, and some 13 years later, I still play the game now and then.
I'm not sure if 99 is an original game my teacher came up with (I still have to check),
but it's one of my favourite card games.  99 is a little like blackjack, in that you can't
go beyond a certain number.  The differences are that you always begin with 4 cards (as opposed
to 2 in blackjack), and up to four players can play against each other.

//////////////////////////////////////

Each player is given four cards.  The objective is to stay in the game as long as possible
by playing cards that will keep you in the game by not increasing the score beyond 99.  If you
don't have the cards to keep you in the game, then you're out!  The last player remaining
is the winner.  Note that the game is a draw if the deck runs out of cards, regardless of
whether the current player had no cards to play.

The score begins at 0.  Each card that is played adds its value to the score (e.g. a 5 of any suit
will always add 5 to the score).  Players can only play cards as long as their values don't
increase the score beyond 99.  Certain cards have special properties that, when played, will
either alter the score in a special way, or change the way the game is played entirely.  The
special cards are as follows:

	10 (Score - 10): reduces the score by 10 (cannot go beyond 0).
	Face card (Score + 10): increases the score by 10.
	3 (Stays the Same): Adds 0 to the score.
	4 (Reverse Turn): reverses the turn order!
	9 (99): Changes score to 99!

	Regardless of the suit, all cards have the same function.

After a player plays a card, he draws a card from the deck, and the next player takes his turn.
If a player loses, he discards his cards.

A minimum of two players can play 99, but up to four can play.  You can add computer-controlled
players, but as always, human players are unpredictable and more interesting players.

There are all kinds of cool ways to make 99 more interesting.  I have a few things in mind,
such as the inclusion of Jokers as wild cards.  They could do anything the other cards can,
and also have their own unique ability, like reset the score to 0.  But if Jokers had that
ability, then you'd have to have a game rule that re-shuffles the deck when it's empty,
because resetting the score could make for a lengthy game.

Online play is an obvious choice for a multiplayer card game.  The only problem is that I don't
know a thing about network programming.  If you would like to add the code yourself, or if
you wish to help me learn network programming, then feel free to send me an e-mail

If you're new to 99 (and you likely are), then heed these suggestions:

-You could potentially end a game quickly if you have a 9 in your hand at the start of the game.
However, make sure that you have a card to save yourself, so your plan doesn't backfire 
(and it could)!

-4's are probably the most powerful cards you can have in your hand.  Always save these cards for
last--you want to try to make the other players use up their good cards before you turn their
own cards against them!  Beware, though--other players can do the same thing to you!

-If you have face cards in your hand, use them ASAP.  They're not good to have when the score is
really high.  If you have a hand full of face cards and the score is 90 or greater, then you
lose immediately.  On the other hand, it may be a good idea to save one face card to cancel out
the 10 that the previous player may have played, possibly leaving the next player after you 
in trouble.
